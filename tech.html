  <p>Hello sir/Ma'am thank you for visiting my blog/portfolio, My name is Vishnuvardhan, and I am currently in the final year of my B.Tech program in Electrical Engineering at IIT Bombay.  </p>
  <p>In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, possessing a diverse skill set is not just advantageous; it's essential for thriving in multifaceted roles. As a seasoned professional, I bring a comprehensive array of skills tailored for both machine learning/data science and VLSI/system hardware design domains. Proficiency in Python programming language, MySQL, Pytorch, Tensorflow, Pandas, Prompt engineering, and fine-tuning of neural network modules equips me adeptly for roles such as Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, AI Engineer, and Deep Learning Engineer. On the hardware front, my expertise spans VHDL, Verilog, Embedded C, Assembly language, and Python programming language, positioning me as a valuable asset for roles like ASIC Engineer, VLSI Design Engineer, and Electrical Engineer.</p> 
  <p>Recent projects serve as a testament to my capabilities and commitment. From spearheading the development of an RFID-based Attendance Management System – earning accolades for innovation and design excellence – to implementing automated multi-class text classifiers at Kotak Mahindra Bank, I've showcased a knack for innovation, problem-solving, and driving operational efficiency. </p>
  <p>My passion lies in harnessing technology to craft impactful solutions that transcend boundaries. I am driven by the prospect of contributing my skills and expertise to high-impact projects, where I can make a tangible difference and propel organizations toward greater success in both machine learning/data science and VLSI/system hardware design realms.</p>
