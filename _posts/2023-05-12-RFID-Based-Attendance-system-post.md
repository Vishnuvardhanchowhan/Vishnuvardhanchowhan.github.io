RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is a form of communication that incorporates the use 
of electromagnetic or electrostatic coupling in the radio frequency portion of the 
electromagnetic spectrum to uniquely identify an object. The aim of this project was to 
build an RFID reader which gets the unique ID of the RFID tag when brought close to reader. 
This reader should be designed to update the information of the corresponding tag to the 
central database, which would act as a management system. We have created an elegantlooking enclosure for our complete internal circuit. So, at the final stage, we have delivered 
our final RFID reader in a 3D printed box. 

It contains a reader module, tags and a database. We had to design a reader module and a 
database. We have designed our reader module using MFRC522 chip and TIVA C as 
microcontroller. Our results will be shown on an LCD screen as well as in our local database 
(in an excel file which we generated using a python script).
