This experiment explores the challenging task of categorizing music files into genres in the field of music informationretrieval (MIR). Two approaches are compared: a deep learning approach using a CNN model trained solely on spectrograms to predict the genre, and a conventional machine learning approach utilizing manually extracted features from the time and frequencydomains. Four classifiers are trained with the features, and the ones that contribute the most to the classification task are identified. The experiments are conducted on the Audio set dataset, and the study concludes by suggesting the effectiveness of an
ensemble classifier that combines both approaches.
