We had built a Remote controlled Hot wheels, which can easily climb any tough terrain beacause of high torque motors installed in it, two files in my Github repo contains the code used for both Joystick and Car installed ESP-32 Microcontrollers, Joystick ESP sends control signals to Motor ESP with WIFI- module and then Motor ESP decodes this message
and send PWM signals to all fours motors accordingly, Whole setup was soldered on GP-Board and then a CAD model was made for hull of the Bot, We had named this Bot as The kharghosh.

for further details head on to my [Github][1] Repository.
